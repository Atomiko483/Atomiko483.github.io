                    <strong>Always Striving to Learn More</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of the making of this website, I am continuing my studies daily making sure I am always up
                    to date with the newest and most effecient methodologies and tools. Currently, I am learning javascript
                    to fully complete my knowledge of the 3 base front-end web development languages.

                <p class="margin__down">
                    I don't focus solely on my current studies, but also effectively plan learning paths to streamline the way
                    I learn information. Roadmaps are a must for me, and I always make sure to stay updated so that I can be flexible
                    and learn new and emerging tools as they become more in-demand. For example, I am learning javascript right now, but
                    have done my research and intend to learn libraries like ReactJS as well as completely seperate topics such as Node.js 
                    and PostgreSQL for backend development as well as Devops principles.

                    <strong>HTML and CSS Learning Process</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I made sure to practice HTML5 and CSS3 extensively without the use of assitive technology like intellisense
                    or tailwind CSS. This was to make sure that even if every tool was taken away from me, so long as I had a place to write code 
                    I would be able to replicate any piece of work I could do using frameworks or assistance. I have since then learned Tailwind CSS 
                    as it is a useful skillset to have, but I consistenly practice my CSS and HTML to this very day. Even this website was coded using no 
                    frameworks, I made all the CSS myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Team Collaboration with Git and Github</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="margin__down">
                    One of the first steps I took in my web development journey after learning HTML and CSS was to learn basic Git 
                    and Github as well as best practices. I recognize the importance of working in a team and being able to share ideas with minimal conflict, so I 
                    considered it an essential habit and skillset to pick up early even without having worked in a team. Being able to work 
                    well with others is one of my strongest skills, and I intend to continue learning  about Version Control Systems like Git in 
                    the near future.

                    <strong>Semantic HTML</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the use of a div or span for styling is acceptable, I never use them to implement features (like a button) that 
                    have a semantic tag built into HTML. Instead, I prefer to use these tags so that assitive technology can use them, and then
                    style them however I want using CSS.

                <p class="margin__down">
                    Speaking of CSS, if I am not using Tailwind CSS for some reason or another, I make sure that my CSS class names
                    follow the naming convention that is agreed upon by the team I am working with (Block-Element-Modifier naming 
                    convention for example). In my own personal work, I tend to use general styles similair to Tailwind CSS such as "flex"
                    or "rotate-90". This websites styling is done in a mix of BEM and my personal style to showcase both naming conventions.
